# Online news coverage of inequality

# Goals: 

This is a course project for SOCI 40133 Computational Content Analysis. The goal is to analyze online news coverage of inequality in the United States. I am now employing the LDA topic modeling, network analysis methods, and word embeddings to the News on the Web (NOW) corpus to see if the coverage given to income inequality from 2015 to 2019 reflects the empirical rise in inequality during the same period. I am also interested in how online media frames income inequality, like the causes and solutions. 

# Methods: 

LDA topic modeling: to see if the online news coverage trend given to income inequality from 2015 to 2020 
    
Word embeddings: to describe the general world view of the online news. After that, I will build several dimensions and project the news onto these dimensions to see if there's any systematic difference (or similarity) in terms of the causes and solutions.

Network analysis:  Considering news itself can be biased, I am going to use network analysis to see the differences of news topics among sources.
